# SampleU – An Open Source Experience Sampling and Ecological Momentary Intervention App for Android and iOS
This mobile application and backend interface allows researchers to conduct experience sampling or ecological momentary intervention studies. The app works on both Android and iOS platforms.

This project is led by Chao Zhang, Daniël Lakens, and Karin Smolders from Human-Technology Interaction group at Eindhoven University of Technology (https://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/industrial-engineering-innovation-sciences/research/research-groups/human-technology-interaction/). 

The development of the app, including the design and coding of the front and back-end, was greatly helped by BOSONIC.design http://www.bosonic.design/
